# Construction Project Data

This repository was generated mostly by Artificial Intelligence (Chat GPT) and contains a dummy dataset for a construction project that can be used for training or demonstration purposes. 

The project is a 10 km highway between the two fictitious British cities of Thortonshire and Haldenborough-on-Sea. 

A sample data model has been put together on the .pbix file, for a quick start, and the .docx file shows a redacted version of the Chat GPT prompts and responses.
